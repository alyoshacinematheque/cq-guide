Context and Positioning of the Collaborative Guide Project

Digital preservation of audiovisual and media artworks has become a shared concern across cultural institutions worldwide. Over the past two decades, numerous organizations have developed frameworks, tools, and strategies to address the unique challenges posed by digital and time-based media. From issues of obsolescence and software dependency to questions of documentation, access, and integrity, the field continues to evolve through collective experimentation and knowledge sharing.

Several major initiatives have contributed to this global ecosystem, including DOCAM (Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage) in Canada, Living Media Art (LIMA) in the Netherlands, and Matters in Media Art, a consortium including Tate, MoMA, SFMOMA, and the New Art Trust. In France, the Réseau HACNUM (Réseau national des arts hybrides et cultures numériques) supports innovation in hybrid and digital arts practices. Institutions such as the ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and international collaborations like the smART Project / International Digital Alliance also play critical roles in shaping preservation methods for complex digital artworks. Within Quebec, the Centre de conservation du Québec provides infrastructure and expertise for the conservation of cultural heritage across disciplines.

While these initiatives have laid essential groundwork, preservation strategies must remain responsive to institutional context—accounting for variations in mission, infrastructure, staffing, and technical needs. This project brings together four Quebec-based institutions—Cinémathèque québécoise, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, and Société des arts technologiques—to collaboratively assess their current digital AV preservation practices. Through a shared methodology, each partner contributes a detailed état des lieux of its internal situation, serving as both a self-diagnostic and a point of departure for developing shared protocols, tools, and decision-making frameworks.

This collective guide thus aims to bridge local needs with global discourse, contributing to a broader culture of openness, experimentation, and mutual support in the stewardship of digital audiovisual heritage.
