Context and Positioning of the Collaborative Guide Project

Digital preservation of audiovisual and media artworks has become a shared concern across cultural institutions worldwide. Over the past two decades, numerous organizations have developed frameworks, tools, and strategies to address the unique challenges posed by digital and time-based media. From issues of obsolescence and software dependency to questions of documentation, access, and integrity, the field continues to evolve through collective experimentation and knowledge sharing.

Several major initiatives have contributed to this global ecosystem, including DOCAM (Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage) in Canada, Living Media Art (LIMA) in the Netherlands, and Matters in Media Art, a consortium including Tate, MoMA, SFMOMA, and the New Art Trust. In France, the Réseau HACNUM (Réseau national des arts hybrides et cultures numériques) supports innovation in hybrid and digital arts practices. Institutions such as the ZKM | Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and international collaborations like the smART Project / International Digital Alliance also play critical roles in shaping preservation methods for complex digital artworks. Within Quebec, the Centre de conservation du Québec provides infrastructure and expertise for the conservation of cultural heritage across disciplines.

This guide thus aims to bridge local needs with global discourse, contributing to a broader culture of openness, experimentation, and mutual support in the stewardship of digital audiovisual heritage.
