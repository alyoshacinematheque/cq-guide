1. Introduction  

1.1 Purpose of the Guide 
This guide aims to offer practical, up-to-date recommendations for professionals working with born-digital audiovisual collections in museums, archives, and studio environments. It is designed to help institutions and creators navigate real-world preservation challenges through clear, actionable tools and agile, adaptable workflows.

1.2 Project Background and Partner Institutions 
Developed through a collaborative effort by the Cinémathèque québécoise, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, and the Société des arts technologiques, this guide responds to an important need for shared, field-tested solutions in the rapidly evolving field of digital AV preservation. Each institution brings distinct technical ecosystems and priorities, making the partnership both diverse and representative.  

1.3 Preservation of Born-Digital Audiovisual Artworks
Born-digital audiovisual works encompass a wide and growing range of materials, from digital camera originals and feature films edited in nonlinear systems to experimental video, performance documentation, and immersive installations built entirely within software environments. While the term born digital might evoke contemporary formats (ProRes files, 4K video, proprietary camera originals) it also includes early computer graphics artworks, CD-ROMs, interactive games, net-based experiments, and emerging generative image systems. This guide draws on and synthesizes multiple institutional perspectives to support sustainable, context-sensitive strategies for preserving complex digital artworks.

1.4 Why Open Source? Principles of Transparency and Sustainability
This guide prioritizes the use of free and open-source software (FOSS) whenever feasible. This decision is grounded in a commitment to transparency, long-term accessibility, and institutional autonomy. Open-source tools are auditable, community-supported, and adaptable to changing technological environments. They reduce dependency on proprietary platforms whose availability or licensing terms may change unpredictably over time. For organizations operating with limited budgets or diverse technical infrastructures, open-source solutions offer flexibility, interoperability, and a clear path to sustainability. By foregrounding FOSS in the workflows described herein, we aim to support a preservation model that is both robust and replicable.

1.5 Methodology Overview
This guide is structured around a microservice approach to digital preservation, favoring small, modular tools and workflows that can be combined, swapped, or extended as needed. Rather than prescribing a single end-to-end system, we emphasize adaptable, interoperable components that respond to specific challenges in context. This approach supports incremental implementation, technical diversity, and long-term resilience.

We draw on the principles of More Product, Less Process (MPLP) to prioritize usable outputs over exhaustive process documentation. Our goal is not to formalize every edge case but to deliver practical, actionable guidance that institutions can implement and refine over time.

Finally, we privilege the use of free and open-source software (FOSS) wherever possible. Open tools foster transparency, sustainability, and institutional autonomy. They allow workflows to be audited, shared, and improved across contexts without the constraints of vendor lock-in or licensing uncertainty.

The recommendations in this document are grounded in eight concrete case studies contributed by the four partner institutions. Each scenario traces a real preservation challenge, documents the steps taken, and distills key lessons into actionable conclusions.
