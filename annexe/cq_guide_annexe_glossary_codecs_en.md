### Uncompressed Video (RAW Video)

Uncompressed video refers to recording or storing each frame as full image data without any compression. It often uses color formats like **YCbCr 4:2:2 or 4:4:4** at 8-bit or 10-bit depth, which preserve all image detail[\[1\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000352.shtml#:~:text=A%20digital%2C%20color,or%20Y%27UV)[\[2\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000352.shtml#:~:text=Uncompressed%204%3A2%3A2%20video%20picture%20streams,provides%20codes%20for%2030%20packed). Typical use cases include professional video capture (e.g. SDI outputs from cameras or film scanners) and lossless archiving, since no information is discarded. In preservation, uncompressed video offers maximum fidelity and avoids generation loss, but produces very large file sizes and high bitrates, requiring substantial storage and bandwidth. It is widely supported and **format-neutral**, reducing future decoding risks – essentially the video is stored as raw pixel data[\[2\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000352.shtml#:~:text=Uncompressed%204%3A2%3A2%20video%20picture%20streams,provides%20codes%20for%2030%20packed). Common container formats for uncompressed video include **AVI, QuickTime (.mov), Matroska (.mkv), and MXF**, often identified by specific FourCC codes (e.g., v210 for 10-bit 4:2:2)[\[2\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000352.shtml#:~:text=Uncompressed%204%3A2%3A2%20video%20picture%20streams,provides%20codes%20for%2030%20packed)[\[3\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000352.shtml#:~:text=Relationship%20to%20other%20formats%20Subtype,Web%20site%20at%20this%20time). Preservationists may use uncompressed encoding for critical content (or during capture) to avoid any quality loss, though more efficient lossless codecs are often employed to save space.

### FFV1 (Lossless Video Codec)

**FFV1** is an open-source, lossless intra-frame video codec developed as part of FFmpeg, aimed at archival use. It compresses video without losing any data, meaning the decoded output is bit-identical to the original source[\[4\]](file://file-2x1C3u3a8h8V9tBz9n5RFQ#:~:text=Lossless%20Compression%20Codecs%3AFFV1%3A%20A%20key,like%20MDPI%20for%20format%20selection). FFV1 supports various color spaces (e.g. YCbCr 4:2:2, 4:4:4, and even an alpha channel) at high bit depths, making it suitable for preservation of both **television video and film scans**[\[4\]](file://file-2x1C3u3a8h8V9tBz9n5RFQ#:~:text=Lossless%20Compression%20Codecs%3AFFV1%3A%20A%20key,like%20MDPI%20for%20format%20selection). Typical use cases include digitization projects and archival master files – for example, many archives adopt FFV1 in a Matroska container as a preservation format to significantly reduce file size compared to uncompressed video while maintaining full quality[\[4\]](file://file-2x1C3u3a8h8V9tBz9n5RFQ#:~:text=Lossless%20Compression%20Codecs%3AFFV1%3A%20A%20key,like%20MDPI%20for%20format%20selection). Preservation considerations: FFV1 is well-documented and now even standardized as RFC 9043, with no patent restrictions. It offers features like built-in checksums for error detection and supports **multi-threading** for faster decoding. The trade-off is larger file sizes than lossy codecs and higher computational load to encode/decode, but these are acceptable in archiving contexts[\[5\]](file://file-2x1C3u3a8h8V9tBz9n5RFQ#:~:text=Considerations%20for%20Lossless%20Codecs%3A%20They,possibly%20greater%20computer%20processing%20capabilities). FFV1 in **Matroska (.mkv)** is recommended by various institutions (it’s a “Preferred Format” at the Library of Congress) due to its openness and robustness[\[6\]](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2023/12/embracing-ffv1-matroska-container-preferred/#:~:text=Format%20Overview)[\[7\]](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2023/12/embracing-ffv1-matroska-container-preferred/#:~:text=Open%20Source%20and%20Affordable). Compatible containers also include AVI and MOV, but MKV is most common for preservation projects.

### HuffYUV (Lossless YUV Compression)

**HuffYUV** is a legacy lossless video codec for Windows, originally released in the late 1990s. It employs predictive coding (similar to lossless JPEG) and Huffman encoding, hence the name[\[8\]](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HuffYUV#:~:text=HuffYUV%27s%20algorithm%20is%20roughly%20the,The%20predictor%20functions%20are). HuffYUV compresses each frame independently (intra-frame), and every frame remains a keyframe, making it easy to seek and edit[\[9\]](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HuffYUV#:~:text=,and%20decoded%20on%20its%20own). Typical use cases were **video capture and intermediate editing**: HuffYUV was popular for digitizing analog video or exporting from NLEs without quality loss when storage and CPU power were limited. It supports YCbCr 4:2:2 and RGB color spaces (8-bit) and was optimized for speed on late-90s hardware[\[10\]](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HuffYUV#:~:text=HuffYUV%20is%20a%20lossless%20video,so%20its%20main%20features%20are). In preservation, one might encounter HuffYUV in older archival files or transcoded outputs, since it was one of the first widely used lossless codecs. It is open-source (GPL) and decoders remain available, so transparency is good. However, HuffYUV lacks support for higher bit depths or modern color formats, and its compression efficiency is poorer than newer lossless codecs (resulting in larger files)[\[10\]](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HuffYUV#:~:text=HuffYUV%20is%20a%20lossless%20video,so%20its%20main%20features%20are). It is most often stored in an **AVI** container, as was standard on Windows[\[10\]](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/HuffYUV#:~:text=HuffYUV%20is%20a%20lossless%20video,so%20its%20main%20features%20are). While largely superseded by codecs like FFV1, HuffYUV played a significant role in early digital video preservation workflows and may still be encountered in legacy collections.

### Lagarith (Lossless Video Codec)

**Lagarith** is an open-source lossless video codec (Windows-based) introduced in 2004 as a fork of HuffYUV, offering improved compression at the cost of lower encoding speed[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=Lagarith%20is%20an%20open%20source,a%20few%20aims%20in%20mind)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=While%20not%20as%20fast%20as,63%2C%20and%20RGBA%20colorspaces). It supports multiple color formats – including YV12 (4:2:0), YUY2 (4:2:2), and RGB(A) – and unlike some older codecs, it avoids color space conversions to prevent any rounding errors[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=be%20slower,each%20frame%20can%20be%20separately). Lagarith uses only intra-frame compression (each frame is independent) and produces all keyframes, which simplifies editing and cuts[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=colorspaces.%20Keyframes%20Disallowing%20inter,joining%20and%20seeking%20much%20easier). Typical use cases included **video editing and archiving on Windows** in the 2000s for those needing smaller file sizes than HuffYUV provided (e.g., compressing screen recordings or computer-generated video losslessly). In preservation contexts, one might encounter Lagarith in collections of computer gameplay videos or fan restorations. While Lagarith yields significantly smaller files than HuffYUV and maintains full quality, it is slower to encode and decode[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=Lagarith%20is%20an%20open%20source,a%20few%20aims%20in%20mind). It is also less widely supported outside Windows, though FFmpeg can decode it. As a preservation choice today it’s largely supplanted by FFV1 and other modern codecs, but its **open, GPL-licensed nature** means content encoded with Lagarith can still be decoded in the future. Lagarith files commonly carry the **“.avi”** extension, since it was implemented as a Video for Windows codec[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagarith#:~:text=Lagarith%20is%20an%20open%20source,a%20few%20aims%20in%20mind).

### Motion JPEG (MJPEG)

**Motion JPEG (M-JPEG)** is a video codec where each frame is compressed *individually* as a JPEG image, with no inter-frame compression[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20rise%20in,demand%20%20143). Technically, it is a simple intraframe codec: every frame is like a still photo (using DCT-based JPEG compression), so quality and compression ratio per frame are similar to JPEG still images. Typical use cases: MJPEG was widely used in the 1990s and early 2000s for **digital cameras, webcams, and non-linear editing systems**[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG#:~:text=M,121%20and%20Microsoft%20Edge). Many early digital point-and-shoot cameras and DSLR “movie modes” recorded video as MJPEG in an AVI or QuickTime wrapper, and some broadcast/editing systems used MJPEG for its moderate compression and easy frame-accurate editing. In terms of preservation, MJPEG’s intraframe nature is advantageous for simple decoding and editing, but it produces larger files than more modern interframe codecs for equivalent quality. It is a **lossy** codec – each frame undergoes compression, which can introduce JPEG artifacts – but because there’s no temporal compression, there are no motion artifacts and no dependency between frames. Preservation issues: MJPEG is well-documented (leveraging the ubiquitous JPEG standard) and broadly supported, so decoding it in the future is low risk. However, its compression efficiency is much lower than later formats; for example, at a given file size, MJPEG quality is typically inferior to MPEG-4 or H.264[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20rise%20in,demand%20%20143). MJPEG video often appears in **AVI or QuickTime (.mov)** files, and on DVD-era hardware it was also used in some video capture cards. While largely obsolete now, archivists may encounter MJPEG in legacy camera files or edited masters, and these can be transcoded to lossless formats if needed to avoid generational loss.

### JPEG 2000 (Motion JPEG 2000\)

**JPEG 2000** is an image compression standard that, in its motion form (JPEG 2000 Part 3), can be used as a video codec by encoding each frame as a JPEG 2000 image. Unlike JPEG (which is DCT-based), JPEG 2000 uses wavelet compression, offering high compression efficiency and the option of **mathematically lossless** encoding[\[17\]](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/PDF/pub9302.pdf#:~:text=Archiving%20lhncbc,a%20truly%20lossless%20compression). Technical characteristics: Motion JPEG 2000 supports high bit depths (12-bit or more), wide color gamuts, and intraframe compression with no inter-frame dependency. It’s known for very good image quality, especially at high bitrates or in lossless mode, and no block artifacts (wavelet compression produces different artifact types). Typical use cases: JPEG 2000 became the standard for **Digital Cinema Packages (DCP)** – digital movie distribution – where each frame is JPEG 2000 compressed. It has also been adopted by some archives and broadcasters for **digital preservation masters** and mezzanine files[\[17\]](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/PDF/pub9302.pdf#:~:text=Archiving%20lhncbc,a%20truly%20lossless%20compression). For example, archival videotape reformatting projects have used lossless JPEG 2000 in MXF wrappers as an open, standard format for long-term storage[\[18\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000013.shtml#:~:text=LC%20experience%20or%20existing%20holdings,version%20or%20profile%20or%20MXF). Preservation considerations: JPEG 2000 is an open ISO standard (ISO/IEC 15444\) with no royalty requirements, which is favorable for sustainability[\[17\]](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/PDF/pub9302.pdf#:~:text=Archiving%20lhncbc,a%20truly%20lossless%20compression). It provides **fully lossless** compression mode, ensuring exact preservation of the source pixels if used in that mode. However, JPEG 2000 encoding/decoding is computationally demanding, and adoption was initially slow – around 2010, few software tools and hardware devices supported it in real time, though this has improved over time. As a result, its use in broadcast archives was limited early on[\[17\]](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/PDF/pub9302.pdf#:~:text=Archiving%20lhncbc,a%20truly%20lossless%20compression), but it’s now more common in niche areas like film scanning and as part of standards like **MXF Application Specification AS-07** (for preservation). Compatible container formats include **MXF** (widely used for JPEG 2000 in digital cinema and broadcasting) and the standalone **.mj2** Motion JPEG 2000 file format, though the latter is less common. Overall, JPEG 2000 offers excellent quality and longevity, and is considered a preservation-friendly codec when storage and processing resources are available.

### DV (Digital Video) – DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO Family

**DV** is a family of digital video codecs originally developed for camcorder tapes in the 1990s. It uses block-based **intra-frame DCT compression** (similar to JPEG), compressing each frame independently[\[19\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=independent%20files,place%20in%20professional%20television%20production). DV operates at a fixed data rate of about 25 Mbps and typically with **4:1:1 chroma subsampling (NTSC)** or **4:2:0 (PAL)** and 8-bit depth, yielding good consumer-quality video for its time[\[20\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=Clarity%20). Variants of DV were introduced for professional use: Sony’s **DVCAM** (same data rate but locked audio sync) and Panasonic’s **DVCPRO**. Higher-bit-rate extensions include **DVCPRO50** (50 Mbps, 4:2:2 chroma for broadcast SD) and **DVCPRO HD** (also known as DV100, \~100 Mbps for HD 720p/1080i video at 4:2:2)[\[21\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=,data%20rate%20of%20100%20MB%2Fs). Typical use cases: DV was ubiquitous in the late 1990s–2000s for **consumer and semi-professional video recording** (MiniDV tapes) and was widely used in TV production and news gathering. Many archives hold raw DV tapes or files from this era. Preservation issues: DV is a lossy format (each frame compression discards some color detail due to 4:1:1/4:2:0 sampling and applies quantization), and it’s limited to 8-bit depth. Consequently, while DV material should be preserved in its native form if it’s the original, it is not ideal for re-digitizing higher-quality sources due to its compression and color subsampling limits. On the other hand, DV is an **openly documented standard (IEC 61834\)** and widely supported in software, so decoding it is straightforward and there are no licensing hurdles[\[22\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=Open%20standards,SMPTE)[\[23\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=incorporated%20in%20files%20is%20also,Licensing%20and%20patents%20None%20identified). In fact, DV’s broad adoption in the 90s and 2000s means support will persist for a long time. DV files can be stored as raw **.dv streams** or wrapped in **AVI, QuickTime (.mov), or MXF** containers[\[24\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=DV%20signals%20are%20formatted%20for,as%20AVI%2C%20QuickTime%2C%20and%20MXF). Notably, low-budget filmmakers sometimes used DV in QuickTime as a “preservation format” because of its small file size relative to uncompressed video[\[23\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000183.shtml#:~:text=incorporated%20in%20files%20is%20also,Licensing%20and%20patents%20None%20identified), though today’s standards favor truly lossless codecs for that role. Compatible audio is uncompressed PCM (typically 16-bit 48 kHz). In summary, DV and its extensions are **important legacy codecs**: easy to play and preserve but inherently lossy, so archives often retain DV data as is, while ensuring future migrations do not further degrade the content.

### MPEG-1 Video (H.261)

**MPEG-1 Video** (ISO/IEC 11172-2), commonly known from Video CD days, was one of the first digital video compression standards (circa 1991). It uses a *lossy*, block-based DCT compression with inter-frame prediction and was designed for about **1.5 Mbps throughput**, encoding approximately 352×240 resolution at 30 fps[\[25\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Moving%20Image%20Normal%20rendering%20Good,off%20to%20make%20sure%20things)[\[26\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Description%20Compression%20encoding%20for%20video,by%20%2010%2C%20QuickTime%20MPEG). Notably, MPEG-1’s design is effectively identical to the ITU-T H.261 standard (initially for video conferencing)[\[26\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Description%20Compression%20encoding%20for%20video,by%20%2010%2C%20QuickTime%20MPEG). Technical characteristics: MPEG-1 supports **progressive video** and uses I-frames and P-frames (no B-frames in the base standard), with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. Quality is moderate by modern standards – for example, a typical MPEG-1 file is **352×240 pixels** and captures only half the vertical resolution of NTSC video (each field, not full frame) to meet the bitrate target[\[27\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Clarity%20%28high%20image%20resolution%29%20Moderate,compression%2C%20and%20the%20encoder%20used). Use cases: It was commonly used for **Video CDs**, early CD-ROM videos, and was extensively employed in the mid-1990s for web and multimedia content[\[28\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Telecommunication%20Standardization%20Sector%29%20recommendation%20H,2%20Layer%20II%20Audio%20Encoding)[\[29\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Adoption). Many early digital library projects and CD-based training videos used MPEG-1. Preservation considerations: MPEG-1 is an **open standard** with no known patent issues today (any patents have expired), and it’s widely decodable[\[29\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Adoption). This makes old MPEG-1 files (e.g., .mpg or .dat on VCDs) accessible for the long term. However, the codec’s limitations in resolution and fidelity mean it does not meet modern preservation quality benchmarks except as an access copy. If an archive holds content originally encoded in MPEG-1, those files can be preserved as-is (since re-encoding won’t improve quality) but might be transcoded to a lossless format if restoration or intensive analysis is needed. MPEG-1 video is typically found in **MPEG Program Stream** files (with extensions like .mpg or .mpeg), often accompanied by MP2 audio[\[30\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Tag%20Value%20Note%20Filename%20extension,2046%20Internet%20Media%20Type%20video%2Fmpv). Overall, MPEG-1’s significance is historical; it proved digital video distribution was feasible on small media, and its **wide adoption for web/PC video in the 1990s** ensures continued support in players[\[29\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000035.shtml#:~:text=Adoption), even as it has been superseded by more advanced standards.

### MPEG-2 Video (H.262)

**MPEG-2 Video** (ISO/IEC 13818-2 / ITU-T H.262) is a lossy video codec that became the standard for **DVD-Video, digital cable/satellite TV, and early HDTV broadcasting**. It enhances MPEG-1 by supporting higher resolutions (SD and HD), interlaced video, and more advanced coding tools (including B-frames for better compression). Technical details: MPEG-2 is a **DCT-based, inter-frame codec** using I, P, and B frames with motion compensation[\[31\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=Description%20This%20description%20pertains%20to,Each%20PES%20packet%20includes%20a). Common profiles include Main Profile @ Main Level (used for standard-definition DVDs at around 720×480/576, 4:2:0 chroma) and Main Profile @ High Level or 4:2:2 Profile (used in studio applications, supporting higher resolution or 4:2:2 chroma)[\[32\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=Adoption)[\[33\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=MPEG,at%20this%20time%3A%20SNR%20Scalable). MPEG-2 video typically is 8-bit and often 4:2:0 in distribution, although a 4:2:2 profile exists for broadcast production. Use cases: It was **widely adopted** – for example, DVD-Video uses MPEG-2 at about 4–9 Mbps, and broadcast TV systems like ATSC (US) and DVB (Europe) made MPEG-2 mandatory for their first-generation digital video[\[34\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=Widely%20adopted%20for%20filemaking%2C%20DVD,exist%20for%20encoding%20and%20decoding). Many TV archival files from the 2000s are in MPEG-2 (including formats like IMX 50, an intraframe 50 Mbps 4:2:2 MPEG-2 used by broadcasters). Preservation considerations: MPEG-2 is an international open standard, thoroughly documented and broadly supported in hardware and software[\[35\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=Disclosure%20Open%20standard,Adoption)[\[36\]](file://file-AH8UoofHcWxUPBGCWjywFQ#:~:text=video%2C%20typically%2050%20Mbps%20for,supported%20by%20the%20vendor%20community). This widespread adoption and standardization mean that decoding MPEG-2 in the future is very likely to be possible, reducing obsolescence risk. However, as a *lossy* codec, it does introduce compression artifacts and some loss of detail, especially at lower bitrates. For preservation, this means one wouldn’t choose to compress new master files in MPEG-2 today, but one may encounter a lot of MPEG-2 content in collections (from DVDs or broadcast masters). Archives often preserve such content in its original form to avoid generational loss, while noting that MPEG-2’s quality is lower than newer codecs at a given bitrate. One advantage is that high-bitrate MPEG-2 (e.g., 50 Mbps I-frame) can be nearly visually lossless and was sometimes used as an intermediate format for archive reformatting[\[37\]](file://file-AH8UoofHcWxUPBGCWjywFQ#:~:text=MPEG,2). Compatible containers: MPEG-2 video is typically stored in **MPEG-2 Program Streams** (with extension .mpg or on DVD as .vob) or in **Transport Streams** (.ts, e.g., for broadcast or AVCHD). It can also be wrapped in **MXF** for professional workflows[\[38\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000028.shtml#:~:text=Spatially%20Scalable%2C%20and%20High,and%20Layer%20II%20Audio%20Encoding), or even in modern containers like Matroska. In summary, MPEG-2 video is a **cornerstone of digital video history**, with a balance of efficiency and quality that was state-of-the-art in the 90s, and it remains important for accessing a huge amount of legacy media content.

### MPEG-4 Part 2 (Visual Coding – DivX/Xvid)

**MPEG-4 Part 2 Visual** is a video compression standard developed in the late 1990s, known for implementations like **DivX, Xvid**, and Apple’s QuickTime MPEG-4. It is a successor to MPEG-2 in the MPEG family, using similar DCT compression but adding features like object-based encoding modes. In practice, the most common profiles (Simple and Advanced Simple Profile) of MPEG-4 Part 2 are fairly similar to H.263 baseline coding[\[39\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=Compression%20encoding%20for%20video%20identical,264%20video). Technical characteristics: It’s a lossy, inter-frame codec supporting **I-frames and P-frames** (and optionally B-frames in Advanced Simple Profile), with **4:2:0 chroma** and up to 8-bit depth. It improved compression efficiency over MPEG-2 for lower bitrates and smaller resolutions, making it popular for early internet video. Typical use cases: MPEG-4 Part 2 was widely adopted in the early 2000s for **downloadable video and computer playback**. The codec achieved fame via **DivX and Xvid** – codecs that could compress DVD-resolution video into much smaller files (a “DVD rip” could be 700 MB, for example). These were commonly stored in AVI files. It was also supported on some portable devices and early **IPTV** systems, and the video-capable iPod (2005) played back Simple Profile MPEG-4 video[\[40\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=Beginning%20in%20about%202005%2C%20there,See%20also%20%2022). Preservation issues: MPEG-4 Part 2 is an open standard, but it did not see as wide professional adoption as its sibling **H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10\)**, and by the mid-2000s it was largely overtaken by H.264 in new applications[\[41\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=Adoption). Many archives will encounter content in DivX/Xvid form, especially in personal digital collections from that era or early streaming/download services. Decoding support remains abundant (FFmpeg, etc.), so access is not a problem. Quality-wise, it’s *lossy* and roughly on par with or slightly better than MPEG-2 for a given bitrate; however, H.264 offers significantly better efficiency, so by comparison MPEG-4 Part 2 video looks more artifact-prone at low bitrates[\[42\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=MPEG,at%20a%20lower%20data%20rate). Thus, for preservation, one would not transcode into MPEG-4 Part 2, but one should preserve original files encoded in it. Compatible container formats include **AVI (very common for DivX/Xvid)**, **MP4/MOV** (MP4 supports MPEG-4 Visual as a codec), and **OGM/Matroska** in some cases. In summary, MPEG-4 Part 2 (often just called “MPEG-4 ASP” for Advanced Simple Profile) was a transitional codec – widely used in its time (e.g., in millions of AVI files) but now largely legacy, overshadowed by more efficient H.264/AVC[\[43\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=Compression%20encoding%20for%20video%20identical,264%20video)[\[41\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=Adoption).

### H.264 / MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC)

**H.264**, also known as **MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC)**, is a widely used lossy codec that became the de facto standard for high-quality video in the 2008–2020 period. Technically, H.264 is a block-based codec with motion compensation like its predecessors, but it introduced new features such as *adaptive entropy coding (CABAC)*, *multiple reference frames*, *advanced intra prediction*, etc., enabling much higher compression efficiency than earlier standards[\[42\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=MPEG,at%20a%20lower%20data%20rate). It supports a range of profiles: from Baseline (low-complexity, no B-frames) up to High 4:4:4 Predictive, which allows for 4:4:4 chroma and up to 14-bit depth. Commonly, **8-bit 4:2:0 High Profile** was used for most consumer content. Use cases: H.264 became ubiquitous – used in **Blu-ray Discs, streaming platforms, broadcast HDTV, DSLRs and smartphones** for recording, and many archival mezzanine files. For example, YouTube and Vimeo adopted H.264 for streaming around 2007–2015, and virtually all consumer devices could play H.264 MP4 files. It’s also used in production pipelines (often as AVC-Intra, an all-intra variant for cameras, or XAVC). Preservation considerations: H.264 is an **international open standard (ITU-T and ISO)**, so documentation is available, but it is heavily patented. Decoding and encoding require a license, though open-source implementations (x264, FFmpeg) have thrived. Long-term, the patent situation meant some hesitation in archival circles to name H.264 as a preservation format, but its ubiquity means support will remain high[\[44\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000081.shtml#:~:text=Adoption%20The%20underlying%20encoding%2C%20sometimes,in%202005%3B%20adoption%20not%20determined)[\[45\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000081.shtml#:~:text=and%20an%20encoding%20variously%20listed,4_AVC_BP). Being *lossy*, H.264 is not ideal for multi-generational preservation (each re-encode loses quality), and it’s computationally complex to encode/decode compared to older codecs. However, if an archive receives camera files or mastered content in H.264, those are often retained as-is given the practicality. H.264 offers excellent quality at relatively low bitrates; for example, an H.264 file at a few Mbps can surpass MPEG-2 at twice the bitrate in quality[\[42\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000080.shtml#:~:text=MPEG,at%20a%20lower%20data%20rate). It also supports **intra-only modes** (used for high-end recording) which can be near lossless. Compatible containers: most commonly **MP4** or **QuickTime (.mov)**, and also **MPEG-2 TS** for broadcast or AVCHD (MTS files), and **Matroska (.mkv)** for various content[\[46\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000081.shtml#:~:text=Relationship%20to%20other%20formats%20Used,ISO%2FIEC%20TS%2030135%3A2014). H.264 was generally a final distribution or production-delivery format (it’s even used in IMF masters in lossless mode for some studios), though for long-term archiving of valuable content, truly lossless formats are preferred. In summary, H.264/AVC is a **cornerstone codec**, combining high efficiency with broad hardware support; it will remain important for accessing a vast amount of video created in the last two decades[\[44\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000081.shtml#:~:text=Adoption%20The%20underlying%20encoding%2C%20sometimes,in%202005%3B%20adoption%20not%20determined).

### H.265 / HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)

**H.265**, also called **HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)**, is the successor to H.264, offering roughly **50% better compression** at the same quality level[\[47\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20main%20advantages,for%20hardware%3B%20capable%20of%20consistent). Approved in 2013, HEVC incorporates many advances: a flexible quadtree coding structure (allowing very large or small blocks), improved motion prediction and intra prediction, support for higher bit depths and **full 4:4:4 chroma**, and more parallelism in decoding[\[48\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=and%20intra%20,HEVC%20in%20a%202017%20video)[\[49\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=HEVC%20is%20a%20important%20advance,varied%20test%20set%20of%20video). Technical characteristics: HEVC can handle up to 8K resolutions, defines profiles for 8-10 bit video (Main and Main10) and beyond (up to 14-bit in High Throughput profiles), and includes profiles for screen content. It’s a lossy codec (with an unofficial lossless mode available) that, in practice, achieves about 25–50% bitrate savings over H.264 for similar objective quality[\[50\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=of%20the%20reference%20software%20for,improvement). Use cases: HEVC is used for **Ultra HD (4K) broadcasting and streaming**, on 4K Blu-ray discs, and in some camera formats. For example, many 4K streaming services (Netflix, etc.) and broadcasters (DVB 4K) adopted HEVC in the late 2010s, and Apple made HEVC the default for iPhone video recording in 2017 (for space-saving)[\[51\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=MPEG,a%20desired%20image%20or%20video)[\[52\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20AOMedia%20and,HEVC%20was). Preservation issues: HEVC is an **open standard** technically, but it is *heavily encumbered by patents* – multiple patent pools have made licensing complex and expensive[\[53\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=The%20underlying%20HEVC%20encoding%20is,Joins). This slowed its adoption in some domains (e.g. web browsers largely avoided HEVC in favor of AV1 due to royalties). For archives, the patent issues pose a risk: relying on HEVC might entail legal or cost barriers for long-term use in open-source tools. Nevertheless, HEVC decoding is becoming common (many hardware decoders exist, and FFmpeg supports it), so access to content is feasible. HEVC is likely to be present in collections of **born-digital 4K videos** and user-generated content from the late 2010s. Its compression is lossy, so, like H.264, archives wouldn’t choose it for intermediate/store-of-record encoding when lossless options exist. But they may need to preserve content that arrives in HEVC (ensuring they maintain high-quality profile files). Containers: typically **MP4 (.mp4)** or **MPEG-TS**/.m2ts for HEVC (e.g., 4K Blu-rays), and **Matroska/WebM** (though WebM opted for VP9/AV1, some use MKV for HEVC). Apple’s **MOV** also supports HEVC (e.g., .MOV files from iPhones). In summary, HEVC represents the state of the art (circa 2015\) in compression efficiency, **supporting higher fidelity video (up to 4:4:4 12-bit) with smaller file sizes[\[49\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000530.shtml#:~:text=HEVC%20is%20a%20important%20advance,varied%20test%20set%20of%20video)**, but at the expense of complexity and patent concerns. As of 2025, it’s widely used in industry but archives are cautiously evaluating royalty-free alternatives for long-term use.

### AV1 (AOMedia Video 1\)

**AV1** is a next-generation video codec released in 2018 by the Alliance for Open Media, designed to be **open and royalty-free** as an answer to HEVC’s patent issues[\[52\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20AOMedia%20and,HEVC%20was). It is a lossy codec that builds upon Google’s VP9 advances and introduces new coding tools to achieve very high compression efficiency. In tests, AV1 can deliver **30-50% better compression** than H.264 and about 30% better than VP9 at the same quality[\[47\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20main%20advantages,for%20hardware%3B%20capable%20of%20consistent). Technical characteristics: AV1 supports up to 12-bit color depth and a **4:4:4 Professional profile** for lossless-quality encoding, as well as 8 or 10-bit 4:2:0 profiles for typical media[\[54\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=,than%20or%20equal%20to%202). It uses techniques like larger transform blocks, adaptive quantization matrices, warp motion, and combined predictive modes from multiple reference frames. It also incorporates film grain synthesis metadata (so grain needn’t be coded as data). Typical use cases: AV1 has been adopted by **web streaming platforms** (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Facebook) to reduce bandwidth costs – especially for high resolutions or on data-constrained networks. By 2025, many modern browsers and mobile devices support AV1 decoding, and it’s being used in some videoconferencing solutions. While not much content in archives is natively AV1 yet, it’s expected to grow for **user-generated content and web video**. Preservation aspects: being **royalty-free and openly documented**, AV1 is very attractive for long-term sustainability[\[52\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20AOMedia%20and,HEVC%20was). There are no licensing fees to worry about, which encourages wide adoption. However, AV1 is extremely computationally intensive to encode (significantly slower to encode than H.264/H.265), which might be a factor for archives considering transcoding to AV1 for access copies. For master preservation, AV1 is still a lossy codec – one could use its lossless mode or high-bit-depth profile, but that’s not its primary design goal. It’s more suited to replacing H.264/H.265 for distribution. Nonetheless, if an archive’s incoming content is AV1 (perhaps from screen recordings or future camera formats), it can be preserved as-is with confidence in decode availability. Container format: AV1 is commonly stored in **Matroska/WebM** containers (WebM is essentially Matroska restricted to VP8/VP9/AV1 video and Opus/Vorbis audio)[\[55\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=Relationship%20to%20other%20formats%20Modification,Not%20documented%20on%20this%20resource). The MP4 format has also defined support for AV1 (ISO BMFF codec code ‘av01’), so .mp4 files with AV1 exist as well. In summary, AV1 is an **important modern codec** combining top-tier compression with an open license[\[56\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=Nonetheless%2C%20the%20HEVC%20patent%20situation,See%20HEVC%20for%20more%20details)[\[47\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20main%20advantages,for%20hardware%3B%20capable%20of%20consistent). For archives, its arrival is promising for creating high-quality access copies without patent worries, though its role for masters is likely limited to cases where only a lossy compressed source is available.

### Theora (Xiph.Org Video Codec)

**Theora** is a free and open lossy video codec developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation, released in 2004 as an open alternative to proprietary formats[\[57\]](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Google-funds-OGG-Theora#:~:text=The%20OGG%20Theora%20codec%20is,2%2C). It is derived from On2 Technologies’ VP3 codec (which was open-sourced) and can be viewed as roughly comparable to MPEG-4 Part 2 or H.263 in capability. Theora uses DCT-based intra-frame and inter-frame compression and typically operates in **4:2:0, 8-bit**. Use cases: Theora was embraced in the mid-2000s by open-source communities and was notably used for **Wikipedia videos and other open content** when HTML5 was emerging – it was supported natively in early Firefox and Chrome builds as the video format for HTML5 \<video\> before H.264 or WebM took over[\[57\]](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Google-funds-OGG-Theora#:~:text=The%20OGG%20Theora%20codec%20is,2%2C). It was often paired with Vorbis audio in an Ogg container (.ogv files for video). Preservation considerations: Theora is unencumbered by patents and can be implemented by anyone, aligning with archival ideals of openness. However, it never achieved compression efficiency parity with the best proprietary codecs of its time – for a given bitrate, Theora’s quality is similar to or a bit below that of contemporaneous MPEG-4 or H.264 Baseline. As a result, industry adoption stagnated once H.264 became ubiquitous, and even Xiph’s own efforts shifted toward supporting Google’s VP8/VP9. Nevertheless, Theora content in collections (from, say, open culture projects around 2005–2012) remains playable – support exists in VLC, FFmpeg, and all major open-source players. Because it’s an openly documented format, long-term decode is not a concern. Theora is rarely chosen for new encodings now, but historically it’s significant as one of the first successful royalty-free video codecs. Compatible container: **Ogg** is the primary container for Theora video[\[58\]](https://wiki.xiph.org/Theora#:~:text=Theora%20is%20a%20video%20codec%2C,future%20scope%20for%20encoder) (hence .ogv files), though technically Matroska could also carry Theora. In summary, Theora represents a **deprecated but historically important codec**: it demonstrated the viability of open video compression and paved the way for later codecs like VP8 and AV1. Archives might encounter it in open-license video files from the late 2000s and can preserve or transcode them knowing there are no legal hurdles to using the content.

### VP8 (WebM Video Codec)

**VP8** is a royalty-free video codec introduced by On2 Technologies and released by Google in 2010 as part of the WebM project. It’s a direct competitor to H.264 Baseline/Main in terms of compression efficiency. VP8 is a block-based, inter-frame codec (with 4:2:0 chroma, 8-bit depth) that achieves roughly the same quality as H.264 **Main Profile** at a slightly lower bitrate[\[47\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20main%20advantages,for%20hardware%3B%20capable%20of%20consistent). Use cases: VP8 was adopted for **HTML5 web video** – Google Chrome, Firefox, and Opera browsers all supported VP8 within WebM container for playing \<video\> content without plugins. YouTube offered VP8 WebM streams for many videos in the early-to-mid 2010s. It was also used in WebRTC for real-time video calls. Preservation considerations: VP8, being open and royalty-free, avoids licensing concerns[\[52\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20AOMedia%20and,HEVC%20was). It saw significant adoption in the tech community, which means decoders for VP8 are widespread (FFmpeg’s libvpx, hardware support in some chips, etc.). As a result, long-term accessibility of VP8 content is very good – it can be viewed as the **“open H.264” of its era**. In terms of quality, VP8 is lossy and a generation behind the latest codecs (it’s less efficient than HEVC or AV1). Archives likely won’t use VP8 to encode new preservation masters, but may very well have VP8-encoded files in web archives or donated collections of digital footage from the 2010s. Such files can usually be kept as-is or transcoded to a lossless format if re-use/editing is needed, to avoid cumulative loss. The primary container for VP8 is **WebM (Matroska variant)** – .webm files typically contain VP8 video and Vorbis or Opus audio[\[55\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000541.shtml?loclr=blogsig#:~:text=Relationship%20to%20other%20formats%20Modification,Not%20documented%20on%20this%20resource). VP8 can also be found in standard .mkv files and even in rare cases in MP4 (though MP4 didn’t officially support it widely). As an example of its role: when RealNetworks and others were looking for alternatives to proprietary codecs, VP8 was highlighted as a new open option around 2011[\[59\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=alternatives.%20For%20example%2C%20MPEG,and%20RealAudio%2C%20and%20for%20related). In summary, VP8 is an **archivally friendly codec** from a licensing standpoint and is part of many modern software stacks, but it represents a generation of lossy compression suitable for distribution rather than archival mastering. It holds historical importance as the codec that pushed the industry toward open video with the WebM format.

### Windows Media Video / VC-1

**Windows Media Video (WMV)** refers to a series of Microsoft’s proprietary video codecs, culminating in **WMV9**, which was standardized as **SMPTE VC-1**. VC-1 is a DCT-based inter-frame codec in the same class as H.264’s contemporaries, offering efficient compression and support for interlaced content[\[60\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=Wikipedia%20VC,broadcast%20and%20video%20industry%20professionals). Technical outline: VC-1 supports advanced profiles that include B-frames, interlaced frame coding tools, and 4:2:0 color at up to 1080p/level 3\. Its design evolved from earlier WMV versions and is comparable in quality to H.264 Baseline/Main at a given bitrate. Use cases: VC-1 was notably used in **HD DVD and Blu-ray Discs** as a mandatory codec (many Blu-rays contain VC-1 video)[\[61\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Wikipedia%20VC,free%20implementation%20of%20this%20codec). It was also the codec behind many **.wmv files** used in the early-mid 2000s for web streaming and downloads (e.g., movie trailers on Microsoft’s sites, or third-party streaming services before H.264 took over). Microsoft’s Silverlight and the Xbox 360 supported VC-1 for video playback/downloads[\[62\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Wikipedia%20VC,free%20implementation%20of%20this%20codec). Preservation: As VC-1 was standardized (SMPTE 421M), its decoding specification is published and can be implemented by anyone[\[63\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=Disclosure%20Decoding%20specification%20is%20an,Adoption). This means that despite being born proprietary, VC-1 is now openly documented, and tools like FFmpeg can decode it. Patents do apply (there’s a patent pool with multiple companies), but by now VC-1 is declining in use. Many archives will encounter **WMV files** from government agencies, education, or personal collections created around 2003–2010. These typically use VC-1 or its earlier cousins. Decoding and migrating those to newer formats is straightforward. Quality-wise, VC-1 at high bitrates was considered very good (some broadcasters used VC-1 for mezzanine files, and Microsoft touted it as on par or better than MPEG-4 Visual). It supports **interlaced video compression natively**, which made it attractive for broadcast professionals transitioning from MPEG-2[\[64\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=H.261%2C%20H.263%2C%20MPEG,broadcast%20and%20video%20industry%20professionals). In terms of container, VC-1 is usually packaged in **ASF containers** (with .wmv extension) for files, or in **MPEG-TS** for Blu-ray and streaming. One preservation concern is that VC-1 never achieved the ubiquity of H.264; thus, long-term, there are fewer hardware decoders produced after its prime. But software support remains, and documentation exists to reimplement if needed. Also, any **DRM** that was sometimes applied to WMV files (Windows Media DRM) could complicate preservation – the files may need to be rewrapped or the DRM stripped, as keys might be unobtainable in the future. Otherwise, as a standard, **VC-1/WMV9 is well-documented and broadly supported**, and the Library of Congress even lists WMV (VC-1) as acceptable for video preservation if re-encoding isn’t feasible[\[65\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=Adoption)[\[66\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000095.shtml#:~:text=Licensing%20and%20patents%20According%20to,exclusive%20licensing%20body). In summary, VC-1/WMV is a **once-popular format** bridging the DVD and H.264 era: it’s an important part of collections from that timeframe and can be preserved or transcoded with relatively low risk.

### RealVideo (RealNetworks Codec Series)

**RealVideo** is a proprietary video compression format (actually a series of codecs: RealVideo 1.0 through 10\) developed by RealNetworks for streaming media. RealVideo was a dominant web video format in the late 1990s and early 2000s, commonly delivered in **.rm or .rmvb (RealMedia)** container files via the RealPlayer. Technical characteristics: early RealVideo versions (RV10, RV20) were based on H.263, while later ones (RV30, RV40 corresponding roughly to RealVideo 8,9,10) introduced more complex, non-standard algorithms (RealNetworks literature claims they are not purely block-based like MPEG-2)[\[67\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Normal%20rendering%20Good%20support,and%20the%20encoding%20option%20selected). The codecs were highly tuned for low bitrate streaming over dial-up connections, and they often ran at reduced frame sizes or rates to accommodate bandwidth. Use cases: RealVideo was **widely adopted for streaming web content** (news clips, proprietary content portals, etc.) starting in the mid-90s[\[68\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Adoption%20Widely%20adopted%20for%20streaming,A%20new%20option%20is). For example, many early internet TV services and some content from sites like the BBC and CNN were offered in RealMedia format. In many parts of Asia, RealVideo in RMVB (variable bitrate RealMedia) format was popular for distributing dramas and movies due to its compression efficiency at low bitrates. Preservation issues: RealVideo is **proprietary with limited public documentation**, and decoding support historically was closed-source (RealPlayer). However, eventually FFmpeg and others reverse-engineered later RealVideo codecs, and today tools can decode most RealVideo files. RealNetworks also provided source access to some developers via the Helix community, which somewhat opens it[\[69\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Disclosure%20Proprietary%20format%20with%20little,Although%20those%20developing%20HTML5)[\[70\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Licensing%20and%20patents%20Licensing%20for,source%20code%20for%20the%20codecs). The format is undeniably *obsolete*: usage declined steeply once more open or standard formats (H.264, etc.) became available and after RealPlayer fell out of favor[\[68\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Adoption%20Widely%20adopted%20for%20streaming,A%20new%20option%20is). For archives, this means RealVideo files should be transcoded for access if needed, but also kept in original form if they’re the source – and ensuring a copy of the last RealPlayer or an FFmpeg-based player is available for future decoding is wise. RealMedia container (.rm/.rmvb) can include some metadata – e.g. title, author, etc., and **supports multiple bitrates in one file (SureStream)** for adaptive streaming[\[71\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Full%20name%20RealVideo%2C%20Version%2010,from%20version%2010%20only%20in). Typically, a RealMedia file contains one video and one or more audio streams (often RealAudio or later AAC). One interesting preservation note is that RealMedia files often rely on the concept of a “**metafile (.ram)**” to stream – an external pointer to the .rm – but for local files the .rm/.rmvb stands alone. In practice, archives might find .rmvb files with higher quality (near-VHS/SD quality) for content that circulated around 2005-2010 especially. Ensuring these can be played (by converting to, say, MP4 H.264) is recommended, as RealVideo decoders may not be common in consumer tools going forward. Nonetheless, given that RealNetworks has ceased pushing its format and openly documented alternatives exist, the **need for proprietary streaming solutions like RealVideo has vanished**[\[68\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000050.shtml#:~:text=Adoption%20Widely%20adopted%20for%20streaming,A%20new%20option%20is). RealVideo’s legacy is a reminder of the early internet video era, and archivists should be on the lookout for .rm files in old web archives or personal archives, recognizing that those represent a once “cutting-edge” attempt at low-bitrate video delivery.

### Apple ProRes (422 and 4444 Families)

**Apple ProRes** is a family of proprietary, high-quality intermediate video codecs introduced by Apple in 2007\. ProRes is *intra-frame only* (each frame compressed independently) and designed to maintain excellent fidelity for **post-production workflows** while significantly reducing file size compared to uncompressed video[\[72\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=Apple%20ProRes%20is%20a%20family,Apple%20ProRes%204444%20Codec%20Family)[\[73\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=ProRes%20was%20designed%20to%20be,the%20majority%20of%20FCP%20users). Technical characteristics: The ProRes 422 family compresses 10-bit video at 4:2:2 chroma (the ratio “422” in the name) and supports any frame size from SD up to 5K[\[74\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=The%20key%20character%20traits%20that,422%20family%20are%20support%20for). Variants include ProRes 422 Proxy, LT, Standard, HQ – differing in bitrate and resulting quality. The ProRes 4444 family adds support for **4:4:4:4** (full color and alpha channel) at 12-bit depth, aimed at graphic and film workflows. ProRes uses a proprietary DCT-based compression that is lossy but visual-lossless at typical bitrates (e.g., ProRes 422 HQ for 1080p is around 220 Mbps). Use cases: ProRes became *ubiquitous in professional video production*. It is the format of choice for many camera recorders, editing, and color grading workflows (especially in the Mac ecosystem but also widely supported on Windows via licensed encoders). A production might shoot in camera raw or another codec but then convert to ProRes for editing; many final masters for broadcast or archiving by studios are delivered as ProRes files. Preservation issues: ProRes is **proprietary** – for years, Apple kept tight control; decoding was widely supported (even FFmpeg can decode ProRes) but encoding was officially allowed only in Apple products or via special licensing. In 2015, Apple published a *Registered Disclosure Document* with SMPTE for ProRes[\[75\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=While%20detailed%20technical%20information%20on,bitstream%20syntax%2C%20the%20bitstream%20element), partially documenting the bitstream for decoding. This improves its transparency for preservation (decoders can be reimplemented from the spec)[\[76\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=While%20detailed%20technical%20information%20on,available%20for%20a%20fee). Still, it’s not an open standard, and it’s lossy, though high bitrate. Archives receive a lot of content in ProRes (e.g., mezzanine files from video producers or digitization vendors), and they often choose to keep it in that format to avoid a generation loss that re-encoding to another codec might cause. ProRes at high quality profiles (422 HQ or 4444 XQ) is considered **visually lossless**, and in fact some archives treat ProRes HQ as an acceptable preservation format for video when truly lossless options result in too much data[\[77\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=ProRes%20codecs%20are%20usually%20contained,See%20Notes%20for%20more%20information). Compatible container: ProRes is almost exclusively wrapped in **QuickTime (.mov)** files[\[77\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=ProRes%20codecs%20are%20usually%20contained,See%20Notes%20for%20more%20information). (Only recently, as of 2016, Apple allowed ProRes in MXF for broadcast delivery[\[77\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=ProRes%20codecs%20are%20usually%20contained,See%20Notes%20for%20more%20information), but .mov remains dominant.) These QuickTime files can contain metadata, timecode, and audio along with the ProRes video. In summary, ProRes is a **mastering codec** balancing quality and size: it’s *not bit-perfect* to the source but good enough to round-trip through post-production multiple times. From an archiving standpoint, its widespread adoption in industry and the availability of decoders means content in ProRes can be preserved and accessed for the foreseeable future[\[78\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000389.shtml#:~:text=but%20rather%20,which%20details%20the%20frame_size%20and). The main caution is that it’s proprietary; however, given its momentum, ProRes appears to be a “born-digital” format that archives will continue to accommodate (similar to how TIFF is accepted for images despite being proprietary in origin).

### Avid DNxHD / DNxHR (SMPTE VC-3)

**Avid DNxHD** (and its extended variant **DNxHR** for higher resolutions) is a family of lossy intra-frame codecs developed by Avid Technology for professional video editing. It was designed as an open alternative to ProRes; Avid submitted DNxHD to SMPTE, which standardized it as **VC-3**[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=Avid%20DNxHD%20%28,3%20standard.%5B%201). Technical characteristics: DNxHD data is 8-bit or 10-bit 4:2:2 compression for HD video (up to 1920×1080)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=DNxHD%20is%20a%20video%20codec,in%20a%20%2059%20container). Each frame is DCT-compressed independently (no inter-frame compression), at various fixed bitrates (e.g., 36, 120, 185 Mbps for 1080p). DNxHR (introduced 2014\) adds support for 4K and higher resolutions and more flavors (including HQX for 12-bit 4:2:2, and DNxHR 444 for 4:4:4 content). Use cases: DNxHD was (and is) heavily used in **broadcast production and post**. It enabled real-time editing of HD footage on moderate hardware, similar to ProRes but favored in AVID Media Composer environments and by some camera recorders. Many TV networks accepted DNxHD 145 (145 Mbps) files as masters, and it was common in tapeless workflows. For archiving, institutions may have preservation masters or mezzanine files as DNxHD – for example, some digitization operations capture analog tapes as DNxHD 220 Mbps files in an MXF wrapper. Preservation considerations: A key aspect is that DNxHD was intended to be an *open* standard; SMPTE VC-3 specifications are published, meaning the codec is documented and not solely reliant on Avid’s implementation[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=On%20February%2013%2C%202008%2C%20Avid,3%20standard.%5B%202). In practice, Avid initially licensed DNxHD encoding—FFmpeg could decode it, but encoding was proprietary until Avid allowed an open implementation. Over time, DNxHD/DNxHR became more open and now are widely supported (FFmpeg, Resolve, etc. can encode it under certain licenses). So, sustainability is good: it’s standardized and broadly adopted in professional circles. As a *visually lossless* intra-frame codec, it’s suitable for preserving content with minimal quality loss, though strictly speaking it is still lossy. Many archives consider DNxHD at high bitrate an acceptable preservation format if truly lossless options are impractical, because it’s well-understood and preserves full HD detail to the human eye. In fact, the Library of Congress has many files encoded in DNxHD as part of certain collections[\[18\]](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000013.shtml#:~:text=LC%20experience%20or%20existing%20holdings,version%20or%20profile%20or%20MXF). MXF is the most common container for DNxHD/DNxHR (particularly OP1a MXF in broadcast), though QuickTime .mov is also used (Avid systems often can import/export DNx in mov)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=DNxHD%20is%20a%20video%20codec,in%20a%20%2059%20container). DNxHR, being newer, is increasingly used for 4K mezzanines and is similarly MXF-friendly. In summary, DNxHD/DNxHR (VC-3) codecs are **preservation-friendly intermediate formats**: open documentation, no playback royalties, and designed for multi-generation use with minimal degradation. Archives receiving Avid projects or network masters will often store the DNxHD files as-is, confident that the format will be supported long-term and that it meets a high quality bar. The only downside is large file size (compared to inter-frame codecs) – the trade-off for easier editing and decoding[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=Avid%20DNxHD%20%28,3%20standard.%5B%201)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avid_DNxHD#:~:text=DNxHD%20is%20a%20video%20codec,in%20a%20%2059%20container).
