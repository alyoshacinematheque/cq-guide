LOCKSS – “Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe,” an open-source program and network for digital preservation of web-published materials (notably journals) developed at Stanford University. LOCKSS implements a decentralized preservation approach: participating libraries run LOCKSS nodes that regularly crawl target content (like e-journals) and store it locally, then cooperate in a peer-to-peer network to detect and repair any content integrity issues ￼. This ensures a permanent, tamper-evident archive for subscribed content. Platform: Java-based server application (usually on Linux). License: Open-source (GPL v2). Status: Actively used (LOCKSS 2.x systems and the Global LOCKSS Network are in production; ongoing development via the LOCKSS Program).
