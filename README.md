cq_guide_project

This repository contains the working guide document alongside PlantUML diagram code for decision trees related to audio, video, and complex audiovisual ingest.

Purpose:

To maintain version-controlled logic diagrams supporting media ingest and preservation workflows for the CQ project.

To provide version control for the evolving written guide.

Contents:
Each .puml file in this repository represents a standalone decision tree focused on a specific media type (audio, video, audiovisual, or more complex works). The written guide is broken into modular documents—one per section—to enable precise tracking and revision.
