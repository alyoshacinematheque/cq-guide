This repository contains the working guide document, as well as PlantUML diagram code for  decision trees related to audio, video, and complex audiovisual ingest.

	•	Purpose: 1. To provide clear, version-controlled logic diagrams that guide media ingest and preservation workflows for the CQ project; 2. To provide version-control for the working guide document.
	•	Contents: Each .puml file in this repo represents a standalone decision tree for a specific type of media (audio, video, audiovisual, or more complex works). The working guide document assigns one document for each section of the guide for precision editing.
