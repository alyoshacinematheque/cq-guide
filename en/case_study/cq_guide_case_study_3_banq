4.2 Case Study 3 – BAnQ

4.2.1 Context and Challenges

In 2019, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) received a major archival donation from Groupe Cossette Communication, a leading player in Canada’s advertising industry. The fonds was remarkable both for its scale and for its hybrid composition, encompassing analog, textual, iconographic, audiovisual, and digital materials. Among the most substantial components were 25 linear metres of textual documents, over 23,000 photographic items, approximately 1,000 audiovisual carriers, a single hard drive, and a set of 6,297 optical discs (CDs and DVDs). From these discs alone, 1.5 million digital files were extracted.

The absence of a unified production schema or centralized metadata system, combined with the fact that this was an unprecedented type of donation for BAnQ, posed immediate challenges in terms of triage, appraisal, and preservation. The files consisted primarily of final deliverables—advertisements and campaign materials—with little information on the creative or technical processes behind them. Additional complexity stemmed from the multi-site origins of the records: several Cossette offices contributed to the donation, each with its own working methods, file naming rules, and folder structures.

4.2.2 Goals and Constraints

BAnQ defined a series of goals aimed at regaining intellectual and technical control over the collection. These included ensuring secure extraction and inventory of digital files, conducting selective appraisal to reduce volume while preserving representative content, maintaining traceability between digital objects and their physical carriers, and meeting donor expectations regarding accessibility, confidentiality, and financial evaluation.

The project was constrained by several material and contextual factors. Technically, data extraction from aging optical media was slow and delicate, with legacy formats further complicating access and interpretation. The COVID-19 pandemic also disrupted physical operations, delaying disc handling and in-person collaboration. Intellectually, the absence of coherent file architecture or contextual documentation required a case-by-case interpretive approach. In some instances, access restrictions imposed by the donor limited possibilities for dissemination or description.

4.2.3 Protocol or Solution Developed

To respond to these challenges, BAnQ adopted a collaborative and iterative methodology grounded in experimentation and internal capacity building. From the outset, staff implemented automated processing chains for file extraction, checksum verification, format validation, and metadata capture. A robotic cleaning system was integrated to accelerate and standardize disc processing. Custom scripts were developed to flag redundancies, identify corrupted files, and detect structural anomalies such as excessive path lengths or deep folder nesting.

A format inventory was compiled, and triage criteria were established to evaluate completeness, coherence, and potential research value. These steps were supported by decision trees, documentation protocols, and version control mechanisms. The work was conducted by an interdisciplinary team bringing together archival processing, digitization, and IT services, fostering a culture of knowledge-sharing and collaborative problem-solving. The tools and resources generated in the course of this project became transferable assets for processing other hybrid collections.

Figure 1 illustrates a sample decision tree developed to guide the evaluation and retention of digital files. Each step of the flow—from completeness testing to format review—helps determine whether a file should be retained, converted, or discarded. This type of tool allowed for systematic analysis while accounting for the specific constraints of the collection.

4.2.4 Implementation and Results

This structured yet adaptable approach produced tangible results. Tens of thousands of files were processed, and significant digital volume reductions were achieved through both automated and manual appraisal. One project area, referred to internally as “Digital Project 18,” initially included nearly 30,000 files totaling 239 GB of data. Following targeted triage and reorganization, this subset was reduced to a coherent and representative corpus.

Figure 2 presents the quantitative results of Digital Project 18. It shows the progressive reduction in file count at each step: initial extraction, automated pruning, and systematic pruning. Through these steps, the corpus was reduced from nearly 30,000 files to approximately 3,100—a reduction of 87%. This rationalization produced a more focused, better-described, and more preservable set of materials.

File inspection and content analysis enabled the team to prioritize materials with enduring value while maintaining a clear record of applied treatments. Traceability between physical carriers and their digital surrogates was preserved through rigorous documentation. The team also succeeded in integrating archival, technical, and financial components, ensuring the retention of monetarily appraised items in accordance with legal and institutional requirements.

4.2.5 Strategic Retention as a Transferable Practice

The Cossette case study offers a model of strategic retention applicable to other contexts. Faced with an overwhelming volume of unstructured and inconsistently described digital files—mostly from legacy optical media and lacking a metadata framework—BAnQ had to make a series of difficult decisions: what to keep, what to discard, and what to prioritize for further treatment. This necessity, born of scale and constraint, revealed a set of principles that may be adapted by other institutions dealing with complex digital acquisitions.

Rather than defining universal technical thresholds or fixed rules, this section presents a strategic retention framework—a decision-making model inspired by the Cossette case. Its goal is not to prescribe actions, but to help institutions build their own appraisal logic based on clearly defined factors: collection context, institutional priorities, resource constraints, and archival values.

4.2.6 Strategic Retention Framework (Derived from the Cossette Case)

Clarify the Collection Context and Preservation Intent

Define the nature and origin of the collection. Does it consist of final deliverables, working files, or both? Is its long-term value primarily evidential, historical, or artistic? What is known (or unknown) about its provenance and production process? Clarify the institutional preservation intent: is the aim exhaustive documentation, representativity, public access, or legal compliance?

Generate a Technical and Descriptive Inventory

Extract file-level metadata using appropriate tools (e.g., MediaInfo, DROID, custom scripts). Compile this data into a structured inventory identifying formats, codecs, durations, folder structures, and other relevant characteristics. Identify errors or structural anomalies such as long file paths, deep nesting, or duplicates.

Define Representativity Criteria

Representativity is not a fixed metric—it is context-dependent. In the Cossette case, BAnQ had to determine what constituted a “representative” advertisement among different format or content variants. Other institutions might consider:

– The breadth of time periods covered
– The presence of both full and excerpted versions
– The technical quality and clarity of files
– Indicators of creative or production evolution

Establish Appraisal and Triage Logic

Formulate the criteria by which files will be prioritized, retained, or excluded. This may include threshold-based filters (e.g., reject files below a certain resolution unless unique), duplication detection methods, or distinctive markers (logos, slates, timecodes). Balance desired exhaustiveness with real-world feasibility.

Apply Tools to Operationalize Retention Decisions

Implement scripts and/or manual workflows that apply the appraisal logic. This may include:

– Flagging files with the same name but differing specifications
– Grouping variants for manual selection of a “best” version
– Identifying and isolating files that do not meet retention criteria

Ensure Traceability and Transparency

All decisions—especially those involving exclusion or de-prioritization—should be documented. Where possible, retain a minimal record of discarded files (e.g., filename, hash, metadata). Maintain linkages between digital surrogates and physical carriers or descriptive records.

This framework, while derived from the specific circumstances of the Cossette fonds, may be adapted to other born-digital heritage collections—particularly those lacking coherent metadata, involving analog-digital hybrids, stemming from decentralized practices, or resulting from undocumented migrations. It is especially useful where resources do not allow for total retention and a selective, analysis-based approach becomes necessary.

By surfacing the underlying logic of strategic retention—not just its outcomes—it becomes possible to turn isolated case responses into institutional memory, and institutional memory into fieldwide practice.

4.2.7 Lessons Learned

Processing the Cossette fonds gave BAnQ a unique opportunity to revise its strategies for managing large-scale, hybrid-format donations. One of the main lessons learned was the need for flexible protocols that combine human expertise with scalable automation. The project underscored the archival value of in-house tools—such as format inventories, metadata reports, and decision trees—that enable adaptation to each collection’s specific features.

It also highlighted the central role of intellectual appraisal in digital preservation, beyond technical conformance. In the absence of structured metadata or stable organization, archivists’ interpretive work remains essential to reconstruct meaning and value. Donor relations proved decisive as well, influencing access policies, appraisal procedures, and retention obligations. Finally, the project reaffirmed the importance of interdisciplinary coordination and iterative planning as foundations of contemporary archival practice.

The insights gained through the development of the strategic retention framework (Section 3.2.6) helped formalize the project’s lessons into a transferable logic extending beyond the Cossette case.
