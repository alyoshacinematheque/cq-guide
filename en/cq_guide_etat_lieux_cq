2.2 Cinémathèque québécoise (CQ)

2.2.1 Existing Infrastructure
The Cinémathèque québécoise (CQ) is a central institution in the preservation and celebration of Quebec’s audiovisual heritage. Renowned for its extensive film, video, and media collections, CQ serves as both an archive and a hub for research, public programming, and professional training in the moving image sector. Its facilities, located in downtown Montreal, include state-of-the-art projection spaces, climate-controlled storage vaults, and specialized laboratories for the conservation, digitization, and restoration of film and audiovisual materials.

In 2024, with support from the PAM initiative, CQ created a new Process Documentation Officer position to strengthen its capacity for documenting and optimizing digital preservation workflows. This role was established alongside the purchase of a dedicated digital audiovisual workstation: a Mac Studio equipped with an M3 Ultra processor and paired with dual 27” 4K monitors. This high-performance setup enables the rapid ingest, transcoding, rendering, and analysis of a wide range of contemporary and legacy media formats, supporting both daily operations and experimental process development. A full breakdown of hardware and related technical resources is provided in the appendix.

2.2.2 Current Practices and Challenges
The CQ’s digital preservation program operates under the direction of the Responsable de production et préservation numérique and the Directrice de la préservation et du développement des collections, ensuring oversight across technical and curatorial domains. The Process Documentation Officer works collaboratively with existing staff to map, evaluate, and refine institutional workflows for digital ingest, metadata management, file normalization, and long-term storage.

While CQ benefits from decades of expertise in film and analog video preservation, the institution is now adapting to the rapidly changing demands of born-digital and hybrid audiovisual collections. Formalized procedures for file-based ingest and normalization are being piloted, and efforts are underway to document current practices systematically. Nevertheless, several challenges remain: legacy digital formats with incomplete metadata, the lack of fully automated fixity checks, and ongoing resource constraints in scaling up infrastructure and training for digital AV stewardship.³

As the PAM project advances, the new infrastructure and expanded documentation mandate position CQ to test, adapt, and eventually formalize new standards for digital audiovisual preservation. This evolving work will not only benefit the institution’s internal collections but will also contribute to wider sectoral efforts and knowledge sharing within the digital preservation community.
