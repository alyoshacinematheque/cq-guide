3.1 Cinémathèque québécoise (CQ)

3.1.1 Existing infrastructure
The Cinémathèque québécoise (CQ) plays a central role in preserving and showcasing Québec’s audiovisual heritage. Its downtown Montreal facilities include state-of-the-art screening rooms, climate-controlled vaults, and specialized labs for conservation, digitization, and restoration.

In 2024, with support from the Museums Assistance Program (PAM), CQ created a new position: Process Documentation Officer for born-digital audiovisual workflows. The role was established alongside the purchase of a dedicated workstation— a Mac Studio with an M3 Ultra processor and two 27-inch 4K monitors. This setup enables ingest, transcoding, rendering, and rapid analysis across a wide range of legacy and contemporary formats, supporting day-to-day operations as well as experimental process development. A detailed hardware and software inventory appears in the annex.

3.1.2 Current practices and anticipated challenges
CQ’s digital preservation program is overseen by the Head of Digital Production and Preservation and the Director of Preservation and Collection Development, ensuring both technical and curatorial supervision. The Process Documentation Officer is working with existing teams to map, assess, and refine institutional chains for digital ingest, metadata management, file normalization, and long-term storage.

Although CQ has decades of experience with film and analog video conservation, it now faces the specific challenges of born-digital audiovisual materials. Formal procedures for ingest and normalization are being tested, and a broader effort is underway to systematize documentation of current practices. Persistent issues include the variety of formats within the Épopée collection, incomplete metadata, and resource constraints that complicate infrastructure development.

As the PAM project advances, the new infrastructure and expanded documentation mandate will allow CQ to test, adapt, and formalize updated standards for digital audiovisual preservation. Once completed, this work will benefit internal collections while helping to shape sector-wide practices and knowledge exchange. Two CQ-specific case studies are presented in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this document.
