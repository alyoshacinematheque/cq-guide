1. Introduction  

1.1 Purpose of the Guide 
This guide aims to offer practical, up-to-date recommendations for professionals working with born-digital audiovisual collections in museums, archives, and studio environments. It is designed to help institutions and creators navigate real-world preservation challenges through clear, actionable tools and agile, adaptable workflows.

1.2 Project Background and Partner Institutions 
Developed through a collaborative effort by the Cinémathèque québécoise, Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, and the Société des arts technologiques, this guide responds to an important need for shared, field-tested solutions in the rapidly evolving field of digital AV preservation. Each institution brings distinct technical ecosystems and priorities, making the partnership both diverse and representative.  

1.3 Preservation of Born-Digital Audiovisual Artworks
Born-digital audiovisual works encompass a wide and growing range of materials, from digital camera originals and feature films edited in nonlinear systems to experimental video, performance documentation, and immersive installations built entirely within software environments. While the term born digital might evoke contemporary formats (ProRes files, 4K video, proprietary camera originals) it also includes early computer graphics artworks, CD-ROMs, interactive games, net-based experiments, and emerging generative image systems. This guide draws on and synthesizes multiple institutional perspectives to support sustainable, context-sensitive strategies for preserving complex digital artworks.

1.4 Methodology Overview
This guide is structured around a microservice approach to digital preservation, favoring small, modular tools and workflows that can be combined, swapped, or extended as needed. Rather than prescribing a single end-to-end system, we emphasize adaptable, interoperable components that respond to specific challenges in context. This approach supports incremental implementation, technical diversity, and long-term resilience.

We also draw on the principles of More Product, Less Process (MPLP) to prioritize usable outputs over exhaustive documentation. Our aim is not to account for every edge case, but to offer practical, scalable guidance that institutions can implement and refine over time.

Wherever feasible, we prioritize the use of free and open-source software (FOSS). This decision reflects a commitment to transparency, sustainability, and institutional autonomy. Open-source tools are auditable, community-supported, and adaptable to evolving technological environments. They reduce dependency on proprietary platforms and help ensure that preservation efforts remain accessible, transferable, and future-proof.

The recommendations in this document are grounded in eight concrete case studies contributed by the four partner institutions. Each scenario traces a real preservation challenge, documents the steps taken, and distills key lessons into actionable conclusions.
