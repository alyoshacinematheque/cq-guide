3.2 Case Study 3 – BAnQ
3.2.1 Context and Challenge
The Cossette collection, held at Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ), contains a vast number of television commercials produced by Cossette, one of Quebec’s leading advertising agencies. The materials span several decades and exist across both analog and digital formats. In particular, a large portion of the collection consists of Betacam SP tapes, many of which were digitized in the 2000s and early 2010s. However, these digitizations were often carried out with access or promotional use in mind, rather than long-term preservation. As a result, many digital files were saved in lossy or unstable formats, with little to no metadata, and were sometimes embedded within DVD structures or copied without consistent naming conventions. Over time, these files were duplicated, relocated, or renamed without adequate tracking, leading to significant disorganization. Although the original tapes remain physically housed at BAnQ, their deterioration and the lack of an internal production database from Cossette present additional barriers to long-term stewardship.

3.2.2 Goals and Constraints
In confronting this situation, BAnQ aimed to reestablish both intellectual and technical control over the Cossette collection. This included determining the provenance and integrity of the various digital files, selecting those that merited long-term retention, and normalizing file formats to align with current archival standards. A central objective was to identify preservation-quality versions and consolidate metadata for each item. The process, however, was constrained by several factors. First, there was no comprehensive inventory or metadata inherited from Cossette. Second, the collection includes multiple digitization campaigns, each with different technical standards and inconsistent outcomes. Additionally, digital files are stored in a wide range of containers—some professional, others amateur—rendering file lineage difficult to verify. Lastly, resource limitations at the institutional level made full re-digitization of analog carriers impractical in the short term, necessitating a selective and strategic approach.

3.2.3 Protocol or Solution Developed
To address these challenges, BAnQ implemented a phased protocol. The first step involved creating a comprehensive inventory of all digital assets related to the collection. This process included identifying duplicate files, potential derivatives, and digital surrogates. BAnQ employed tools such as MediaInfo to extract technical metadata and assess file characteristics, including resolution, codec, and bitrate. These metrics were then used to infer file lineage and determine which versions were likely to be of higher quality or closer to the original source. Where possible, selected files were normalized into archival wrappers, specifically Matroska containers with FFV1 encoding. Alongside this rewrapping process, the institution began enriching records with preservation metadata, such as PREMIS-style fixity data, format history, and contextual notes. In cases where no satisfactory digital surrogate could be confirmed, the corresponding analog tapes were flagged for potential re-digitization. This triage-based approach enabled BAnQ to begin managing the collection effectively despite limited resources.

3.2.4 Implementation and Results
The implementation phase began with a batch of approximately 100 files selected for close analysis and normalization. The inventory process quickly revealed significant redundancies—many files shared identical or near-identical names, but were in fact different versions in terms of format, quality, or duration. Several digitizations displayed compression artifacts or visual degradation, confirming the need for reprocessing. Through MediaInfo reporting and manual review, BAnQ established basic file lineage in many cases and began grouping variants under common identifiers. Normalized files were rewrapped into Matroska containers and fixity checks were generated. Additionally, internal documentation was developed to describe the rationale behind file selection, normalization criteria, and metadata attribution. These tools will help inform future efforts and ensure consistency across staff and time. The pilot project also provided a testing ground for developing lightweight workflows that could be scaled to other legacy digital collections.

3.2.5 Lessons Learned
The Cossette case illustrates the long-term challenges posed by early digitization practices that did not adhere to preservation standards. Chief among these is the difficulty of managing digital files when neither descriptive metadata nor source documentation is available. File names alone proved unreliable as indicators of content, requiring deep analysis to establish relationships between items. The project reinforced the importance of technical metadata, provenance tracking, and clear documentation — even when implemented retroactively. Furthermore, BAnQ recognized that a phased approach, starting with inventory and progressing toward normalization, is not only more manageable but also more effective in building institutional knowledge and capacity. Finally, the case underscores the value of treating even legacy access files with care, as they may represent the only extant copy of historically significant audiovisual material.
