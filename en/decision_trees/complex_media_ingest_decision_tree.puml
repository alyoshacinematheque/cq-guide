if ("Is this more than simple audio/video playback?"?) then (Yes)
  :Continue with complex media ingest;
else (No)
  :Use simple ingest workflow;

:Determine primary media type;

if ("Is it time-based,\ninstallation-based, or both?"?) then (Time-based)
  :Check for interactivity or runtime execution;
elseif (Installation-based)
  :Check spatial & hardware needs;
else (Both)
  :Evaluate all branches;

:Evaluate for software or control systems;

if ("Does it include software, generative elements, or interactivity?"?) then (Yes)
  :Identify software environment;

  if ("Is it runtime-based?\n(TouchDesigner, Unity, Max/MSP, etc.)"?) then (Yes)
    :Capture version, OS, GPU, runtime dependencies;
    if ("Is source code or project file available?"?) then (Yes)
      :Preserve config and source;
    else (No)
      :Preserve runtime via disk image or VM;

  if ("Is software proprietary or licensed?"?) then (Yes)
    :Document license type and validity;

:Evaluate hardware dependencies;

if ("Does the work require custom or dedicated hardware?"?) then (Yes)
  :Photograph components;
  :Diagram wiring, control signals;
  if ("Are parts replaceable or simulatable?"?) then (Yes)
    :Document acceptable substitutions;
  else (No)
    :Flag for potential obsolescence;
  endif
endif

:Evaluate spatial / environmental needs;

if ("Is spatial configuration essential\n(e.g. projection, speakers)?"?) then (Yes)
  :Document geometry, placement, calibration files;
endif

if ("Does the work include spatial audio?"?) then (Yes)
  :Preserve multichannel stems;
  :Map channel layout and routing;
endif

:Evaluate activation and performance;

if ("Is the work performed live or cue-based?"?) then (Yes)
  :Collect tech rider, cue sheets, interaction logic;
endif

if ("Can the work be re-performed or delegated?"?) then (Yes)
  :Document conditions and performer role;
else (No)
  :Preserve as fixed performance documentation;
endif

:Check artist intent;

if ("Is the work open to reinterpretation or simulation?"?) then (Yes)
  :Record flexibility parameters;
else (No)
  :Document fixed constraints;
endif

:Finalize ingest;

:Package all components;
:Include media, software, config, spatial data, artist intent;
:Store as BagIt or OCFL object;
